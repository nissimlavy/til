#Staging changes interactively

Using `git add`, we can add all of the changes of a file. However, if you want to only add some of the changes of a file to be committed, you can use `git add --patch` or `git add -p` to interactively decide which changes you'd want to include in a commit.

This is useful if you've been working on a lot of changes or different things in one session/branch, and you only want to commit *some* of your changes.
